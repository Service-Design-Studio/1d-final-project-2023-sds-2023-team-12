1. Before running the tests, ensure that the test database is clean and does not contain any existing user records.
Enter command 'rails db:reset RAILS_ENV=test' and 'rails db:drop db:create db:schema:load'

2. To run all tests,
Enter command 'rails test'

3. To run a particular test,
Enter command 'rails test {path to file}'
Change {path to file} to actual path to that test file 
(e.g.test/models/user_test.rb)
